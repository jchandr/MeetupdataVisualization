Data Visualization for RSVPs made in meetup community using PubNub JavaScript API and Eon gio map
=================================================================================================

This is a simple application which displays RSVPs made for any event by members of meetup groups from all over the world. 

Meetup is a community where everyone posts their events and people who are interested can RSVP to those events an participate. They provide stream of data of RSVPs which are made by their members to all the events using their API. I collect those RSVPs and using PubNub JavaScript API and Eon gio maps, I publish them as dropped pins in the world map. 

When you click on a pin, the user who RSVP to the event and the name of the event is displayed as popup. 

-----------------------------
Steps to run the application:
-----------------------------
1. Clone or download the application
2. Run the index.html file in any of the browser. (I have entered my publish key and subscribekey in the html page)


Note: 
1. Since for the test purpose I directly entered my publishkey and subscribekey in the github which is usually wrong. Always the keys should be private.
